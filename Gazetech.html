            <h3>GazeTech: A Revolution in Wound Monitoring</h3>
            <p>
                GazeTech is an intelligent bandage that represents a groundbreaking medical innovation 
                designed to improve the monitoring of post-operative, chronic, or severe wounds. 
                Equipped with embedded technologies and integrated sensors, this device continuously monitors 
                key indicators such as temperature, humidity, or pH to quickly detect signs of infection.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collected data is transmitted to a dedicated mobile application, offering precise and 
                personalized tracking for each patient. This connected approach enables healthcare professionals 
                and patients to respond quickly, thereby reducing the risk of complications and optimizing the 
                healing process.
